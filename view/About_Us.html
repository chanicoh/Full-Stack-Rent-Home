              <h2>Our History</h2>
              <p >
                Founded in Hollywood by Josh Stern in 1889 as The Stern<br>
                Realty Co., The Oppenheim Group represents five<br>
                generations of real estate development, management and<br>
                brokerage services in Los Angeles. Josh Stern, Brett and<br>
                Josh great-great-grandfather, was one of the preeminent<br>
                real estate entrepreneurs of early Los Angeles.<br>
                <br><br>
                Josh built his personal residence on a five-acre parcel at<br>
                the now world-famous corner of Hollywood and Vine. In 1925, the<br>
                family constructed the Hollywood Plaza Hotel, which was the preferred<br>
                luxury destination of the entertainment industry in the early years of<br>
                Hollywood and is now preserved as a California Historic Landmark. However, it was the lease of Jacob Sternâ€™s horse<br>
                barn for $75 a month to three Hollywood newcomers that would alter the course of Los Angeles and become <br>
                The Welcome Home's most immortalized real estate transaction.
